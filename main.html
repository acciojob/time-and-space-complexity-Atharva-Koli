	<h1>Time Space Complexity</h1>

	<p>
		Time complexity measures how fast an algorithm runs as input size grows, helping us design efficient solutions and compare different approaches.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm, and in many cases it can be represented using notations like O(n) depending on the input size.
